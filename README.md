#Code for Street Similarity and Uniqueness from a Walk-through Perspective
##Introduction
This project aims to provide a codebase focused on street similarity and uniqueness from a walk-through perspective, concentrating on constructing street sequences and comparing similarities across different dimensions: Landscape (SV), Safe Perception, and Function. This codebase will assist researchers and developers in better understanding the similarities and uniqueness of street features, with applications in urban planning and design.

##Project Structure
###1. Landscape (SV)
This section of the code implements the construction of street sequences based on landscape features and further compares the similarities between different streets.

###2. Safe Perception
The safe perception dimension primarily focuses on the safety perception characteristics of streets. This part of the code uses safety perception scoring to construct street sequences and compare their similarities.

###3. Function
The function dimension involves the usage and functional characteristics of streets. This section of the code implements the construction of street sequences based on street functions, such as commercial activities and residential areas.

###Experimental Data
To support our research, we utilized experimental data and results from Chengdu. This data encompasses street features, similarity, and uniqueness indicators from various regions of Chengdu.
