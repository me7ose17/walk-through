# Code for Street Similarity and Uniqueness from a Walk-through Perspective

## Introduction
This project aims to provide a codebase focused on street similarity and uniqueness from a walk-through perspective, concentrating on constructing street sequences and comparing similarities across different dimensions: Landscape (SV), Safe Perception, and Function. This codebase will assist researchers and developers in better understanding the similarities and uniqueness of street features, with applications in urban planning and design.

## Project Structure

1. **Landscape (SV)**: Implements the construction of street sequences based on landscape features and compares similarities between different streets.
   
2. **Safe Perception**: Focuses on safety perception characteristics of streets, using scoring to construct sequences and compare similarities.
   
3. **Function**: Involves usage and functional characteristics of streets, implementing sequences based on street functions, such as commercial activities and residential areas. Then compares similarities between different streets
